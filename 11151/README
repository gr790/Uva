This problem can also be done as a variation of a very common problem called the LCS(Longest Common sub sequence) problem. 

Let the input string be represented by a character array s1[0...n-1].

1) Reverse the given sequence and store the reverse in another array say s2[0..n-1] which in essence is s1[n-1....0]

2) LCS of the given sequence s1 and reverse sequence s2 will be the longest palindromic sequence.

This solution is also a O(n^2) solution.
