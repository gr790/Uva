A common problem when processing incoming text is to isolate
the words in the text.  This is made more difficult by the
punctuation; words have commas, "quote marks",
(even brackets)      next to them, or hy-
phens in the middle of the word.  This punctuation doesn't
count as letters when the words have to be looked up in a
# dictionary by the 12345 "**&! program.
